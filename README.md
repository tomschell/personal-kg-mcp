# Personal Knowledge Graph MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for maintaining a local, private knowledge graph of decisions, progress, insights, and questions during development.

## Overview

The Personal KG MCP server provides tools to capture, search, and manage knowledge during development work. It focuses on essential functionality to reduce cognitive load while maintaining a comprehensive knowledge base.

## Why Personal Knowledge Graph?

### The Problem
As developers, we constantly make decisions, solve problems, and gain insights that get lost in the noise of daily work. Important context disappears when:
- Switching between projects or tasks
- Returning to code after time away
- Onboarding new team members
- Debugging issues that resurface months later
- Trying to remember "why we did it that way"

**But the biggest challenge is agentic development**: AI assistants like Claude and Cursor start each session with zero context about your project history, decisions, and progress. Every conversation becomes a ground-up explanation, wasting time and losing valuable context.

### The Solution
A Personal Knowledge Graph captures your development journey as it happens, creating a searchable, connected memory of your work. Think of it as a second brain that:
- **Remembers everything** - Decisions, progress, insights, and questions
- **Connects the dots** - Links related work across time and projects
- **Provides context** - Gives you the full story when you need it
- **Scales with you** - Grows more valuable over time

**For agentic development, it's your AI assistant's memory**: The Personal KG gives AI tools like Claude and Cursor instant access to your project context, decisions, and progress history. No more starting from scratch every session.

**It's effectively a communications layer** between you and your AI assistants, between different development sessions, and between team members. It bridges the gap between human context and AI capabilities.

### Key Benefits

#### üß† **Reduced Cognitive Load**
- Stop trying to remember everything
- Focus on current work, not context switching
- Quick access to relevant background information

#### üîÑ **Seamless Context Switching**
- Resume any project with full context
- Understand the "why" behind past decisions
- Pick up where you left off, even months later
- **AI assistants start with full project context** - No more explaining your codebase from scratch

#### üìà **Accelerated Learning**
- Build on past insights and avoid repeating mistakes
- Track your problem-solving patterns
- Identify recurring challenges and solutions

#### ü§ù **Better Collaboration**
- Share context with team members
- Document decisions for future reference
- Maintain institutional knowledge
- **AI-human collaboration** - Your AI assistant understands your project as well as you do
- **Communications bridge** - Seamless information flow between human context and AI capabilities

#### üéØ **Improved Decision Making**
- Reference similar past situations
- Understand the full impact of decisions
- Track the evolution of your thinking

### Real-World Scenarios

**Scenario 1: AI Assistant Session Continuity**
> "I'm starting a new session with Claude to work on the authentication system. How do I avoid explaining the entire project history again?"

**With Personal KG**: `kg_session_warmup({ project: "auth-system" })` gives your AI assistant instant context about recent decisions, blockers, and progress - no more ground-up explanations.

**Scenario 2: Returning to a Project**
> "I need to work on the authentication system again, but it's been 3 months. What was I thinking about the OAuth flow?"

**With Personal KG**: `kg_session_warmup({ project: "auth-system" })` gives you recent decisions, blockers, and context in seconds.

**Scenario 3: Debugging a Recurring Issue**
> "This database connection error feels familiar. Have I seen this before?"

**With Personal KG**: `kg_semantic_search("database connection timeout")` finds related debugging sessions and solutions.

**Scenario 4: Onboarding a New Developer**
> "I need to explain our architecture decisions to the new team member."

**With Personal KG**: `kg_query_context("architecture decisions")` provides a comprehensive overview of key decisions and reasoning.

**Scenario 5: Planning a Refactor**
> "I want to refactor this module, but I need to understand what depends on it."

**With Personal KG**: `kg_get_project_state("module-refactor")` shows related work, dependencies, and potential impacts.

### How It Fits Your Workflow

The Personal KG integrates seamlessly with your existing development tools:

#### **üîÑ Daily Development Cycle**
1. **Start work** ‚Üí `kg_session_warmup()` gets you and your AI assistant up to speed
2. **During coding** ‚Üí `kg_capture()` records decisions and progress
3. **Link related work** ‚Üí `kg_create_edge()` connects related concepts
4. **End session** ‚Üí `kg_capture_session()` summarizes and plans next steps

#### **üõ†Ô∏è Tool Integration**
- **MCP Protocol** - Works with Claude, Cursor, and other AI assistants
- **GitHub Integration** - Automatically captures issue and PR context
- **Local Storage** - Your data stays private and under your control

## Usage Guide

### Tag Conventions
- Normalised tags: `proj:<name>`, `ws:<workstream>`, `ticket:<id>`  
- Examples: `proj:kg`  `ws:kg-dev`  `ticket:78`

### Proactive Behavior
1. Capture key moments with **kg_capture** (decisions, progress, insights, questions).  
2. At session boundaries use **kg_capture_session** (include `next_actions[]`).  
3. When resuming a topic call **kg_query_context** or **kg_get_project_state**.  
4. Link entries to the active session and mark dependencies with **kg_create_edge**.
